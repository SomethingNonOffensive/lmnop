## LMNOP Setup

This repository includes a sample Flask app `app.py`.
To run it, install dependencies and set environment variables:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export SECRET_KEY="change_me"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="change_me"
python app.py
```

`SECRET_KEY` is required so session and CSRF tokens remain valid between restarts.
